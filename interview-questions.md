# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: It is as the word says, it's a statement that declare a condition for a function or variable. It's composed
by an `if` or `else if` or `else` statement.

Researched answer: "Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run. “If” statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code. “Else” statements: where if the same condition is false it specifies the execution for a block of code. “Else if” statements: this specifies a new test if the first condition is false." font: "https://www.javascript.com/learn/conditionals" also did some research on the Syllabus and found "Conditional statements, or if/else statements, are fundamental to computer programming. Conditional statements are a sequence of well-defined instructions that produce a unique output based on the value of the input. Conditionals follow a flowchart-like structure and allow you create logic in your code."

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a local storage that tracks/control your files and changes made to them and GitHub is a online collab platform that you can use to work with other devs on a project.

Researched answer: Git it's a version control, tracks source code history, on your local machine,open-source,free. Git Hub is an online collab, share your code with other developers, hosting service, it is also a project management platform. font: my notes.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Equality operators(== and ===) and Relational operators( > , < )

Researched answer: Equality Operators (loose equality turns converts two items into the same data type before making a comparison and the stricly equality requires the two items that are being compared to be the same dat type to return true), Relational Operators( > , < , >= , <= ) and Logical Operators ( && and operator states that both sides of the equation must be true, || or operator states that at least one side of the equation must be true, ! not operator is denoted by a bang operator that sets the logical opposite).

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The difference between an array's index and its value is that the Index shows where the data is located starting from 0 and its Value show what is inside the array.

Researched answer: The difference between an array's index and its value is that the Index will give you the element position starting from 0, Value describes the content of an element.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Array is a container for data, String is a value and it can be a word or a number/numeral also String is immutable and with the Array you can modify it by using a Method. 

Researched answer: Array is a linear data structure that holds a collection of elements having the same data types, it can be both one and two-dimensional, it is mutable, it has a fixed size and it can save the integer, float and doubles. 
String is an object that defines a series of characters, it is always two-dimensional, it stores only char data types, String also only have fixed sizes but it can be modified through char pointer, String is immutable and can only store char value.  // font: google search got me to this website "https://byjus.com/gate/difference-between-array-and-string-in-java/#:~:text=The%20key%20difference%20between%20Array,is%20a%20collection%20of%20characters"

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is the action of two persons coding togheter, one does researches and guide (Navigator) and the other person code (Driver.)

Researched answer: Two developers working togheter to solve/write code. 
The Navigator has the responsibility of watching,thinking,advising, higher-level inputs to the code, catching error, bugs, typos. 
The Driver use the keyboard and mouse to code, manage the editor and comunicate with the Navigator, it is important that both person talk to each other constantly and that they understand whys and hows. // font: notes,syllabus.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

// quick note : JavaScript = JS

1. Higher Order Functions:  In JS, Higher-order functions are built in methods that are specific subset of built in methods that take a function as a n argument.

2. Jest: Jest is a JS testing framework designed to ensure correct input of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an easier. Jest is well-documented, requires little configuration and can be extended to match your requirements.

3. Objects: In JS, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a pen, for example. A pen is an object, with properties. A pen has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

4. Method: In JS, methods are object properties containing a function definition. Within the function definition, "this" can be used to refer to the containing object as long as the function is defined within the object.

5. Classes: In JS, Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. They are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.
